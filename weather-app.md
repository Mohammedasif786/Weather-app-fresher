## Project Plan for Weather App

### 1. Set Up Project Environment

- Create a project folder.
- Inside the folder, create three files:
    - `index.html` for the webpage structure.
    - `styles.css` for styling the app.
    - `script.js` for JavaScript functionality.


### 2. Design HTML Structure

- Create a container for the app.
- Add an input field to enter a city name.
- Add a search button.
- Add elements to display weather details such as location, temperature, description, wind speed, and weather icon.


### 3. Style with CSS

- Use CSS to style the app container for a clean layout.
- Style input, button, and weather information sections for good UX.
- Responsive design so the app looks good on different devices.


### 4. Add JavaScript Functionality

- Create an event listener for the search button to get the city input.
- Use `fetch()` to call a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- Parse the JSON response to extract weather data.
- Display the data (temperature, description, icon, wind speed) in the HTML elements.
- Handle errors when the city is not found or API call fails.


### 5. Test the App

- Test with different city names.
- Verify error handling with invalid inputs.
- Check styling and responsiveness.


### Optional Enhancements

- Show weather forecast for next few days.
- Auto-detect user location and show weather by default.
- Add loading spinner while fetching data.
- Improve UI with animations or icons.

This plan provides a clear step-by-step approach to build a basic weather app using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can start by focusing on the HTML structure, then move to styling and JavaScript functionality.

If needed, I can provide code samples or help with any specific step. Let me know if detailed implementation guidance is required.

This plan is inspired by various tutorials and guides on building weather apps with these technologies [^1][^2][^3].
